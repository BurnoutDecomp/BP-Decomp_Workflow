@echo off
rem Build a minimal SHARED FFmpeg (MSVC toolchain) into b5-decomp\vendor\ffmpeg-build\ for the movie
rem player (Phase 3 / VP6 + MP4). The actual build steps are in build_ffmpeg.sh (run under MSYS2 bash);
rem this wrapper puts the right toolchain on PATH:
rem   - cl/link  : VS2022 vcvars64
rem   - nasm/gcc : Strawberry Perl (C:\Strawberry\c\bin)   [asm is disabled, but configure probes it]
rem   - make/bash: MSYS2 (C:\msys64\usr\bin), appended so MSVC's link.exe wins over MSYS2's /usr/bin/link
setlocal
set ROOT=%~dp0..\..

rem Accept an already-configured toolchain ONLY if cl is a modern MSVC (19.x).
rem A plain "where cl" is not enough: the Xbox 360 SDK puts an ancient cl (14.x)
rem on PATH that wins the lookup, and FFmpeg's configure rejects it
rem ("Unsupported MSVC version"). Run vcvars in that case so VS2022's cl is
rem prepended and wins.
rem IMPORTANT: probe with "where cl" FIRST. Piping a command that is not on PATH
rem (cl 2>&1 | findstr ...) aborts the whole batch with exit 255 -- and locally there
rem is NO cl until vcvars runs, so the bare pipe killed this script instantly and
rem vendor\ffmpeg-build was never produced (game build then fails on avcodec.h).
